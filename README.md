## Week 12: Final Project Part 1

### Project revise: 
- Use the light sensor to achieve the function of switch: The device turn on during the night, turn off at the daytime.
- The MP3 speaker cable is to play the voice of "Get away from my house!"
- Distance sensor to perceive if the stangers come close to the outdoor.
- LED light will turn on fade with the speaker's voice at the same time.

#### Resources of the sensors:
- Distance sensor: 
- LED Fade : 
- MP3 Speaker Cable: 
- Light sensor: 

#### Process part 1:



## Week 11: Final Project Proposal

### Concept: Get away from my house!

- This is a security device to drive strangers out of the door after midnight. It installs near the doorway. Now my roommates and I are living in a house in Ocean Ave. There is a potential safety hazard when we fall asleep, especially during the coronavirus time. This device can help us to scare the strangers coming at midnight. 

- How it works: This device turns on only at midnight. Use the remote control to turn on the device. If there is someone close to the door at midnight, the distance sensor will detect him. Then the speaker will yell at the stranger: “Get away from my house!”. Meanwhile, the led light will turn on.

##### Must have
- Basic Parts: Bread board / Wire / Arduino Uno board
- Remote Controller
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- LED Light
- Speaker : https://www.adafruit.com/product/1314 / https://www.adafruit.com/product/1313 / https://www.adafruit.com/product/1313  (Select one of them)

##### Nice to have
- LED RGB Light (Coding the fade on)
- Remote Control the device on and off.

#### Steps to use the device :
- Use the remote controller to turn on the device at the midnight.
- When the strange person comes close, the led light will fade. 
- Meanwhile, the speaker will yell at the stranger: " Get away from my house!"
- Turn off the device when you get up.

- Optional : This device can also use during the time that the residents are not at home.

- Storyboard about how to use the device:

#### Steps to make the device :
- Set up the remote controller to turn the device on at the midnight and turn off during the daytime.
- Write the coding of remote controller, ultrasonic distance sensor, LED and Speaker.
- Find a way to record the voice which can play on the speaker. 
- Install them on the outdoor. 


## week7

- In this week, Sissi, Tianbai and I work as a group to create the vehicle project. In our project, we make a vehicle which can avoid the obstacles and change the direction.

 - Then we use the led as an output to develop our device.

## week6

In week6, I make some sketches to describe how can I create a vehicle. At the beginning, I attempted to create a vehicle only with two motors. Later I found that it is difficult to make the vehicle change the direction. Then I decided to create a vehicle with 4 motors to motivate the wheels.

In this sketch, I am going to laser cut the wheels to assemble the vehicle. I measure the size of the wheels and the board on the top of the vehicle. (Sorry to write in Chinese, it is to understand easier for me.)

## week5

In week 5, I attempt the digital screen display. This is one part of my midterm work. I plan to create a device that can detect the distance. The number of distance can display on the digital screen. Previously, I got fair on the screen, which showed only the several squares on it. Then professor and I try to figure it out. There is a mistake with the wire connection. Then we tried to reconnect it. It works as I expect.

- Mistake on digital screen:

## week4_2 led gif
- This week I create the circuit with 2 leds. These two leds can flash alternately.

## week 2_ link to drawing machine
- Here is my simply drawing machine recording video. It supposes to be drawing automatically motivated via a motor. However, there are some problems when I try to turn on the machine. First, the motor cannot drive the machine to spin automatically. Next, it might be a friction that affects the movement. I will continue to fix those problems as soon as possible.
