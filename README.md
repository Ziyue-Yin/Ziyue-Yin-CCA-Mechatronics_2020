## week7

- In this week, Sissi, Tianbai and I work as a group to create the vehicle project. In our project, we make a vehicle which can avoid the obstacles and change the direction.

 - Then we use the led as an output.

## week5

In week 5, I attempt the digital screen display. This is one part of my midterm work. I plan to create a device that can detect the distance. The number of distance can display on the digital screen. Previously, I got fair on the screen, which showed only the several squares on it. Then professor and I try to figure it out. There is a mistake with the wire connection. Then we tried to reconnect it. It works as I expect.

- Mistake on digital screen:

## week4_2 led gif
- This week I create the circuit with 2 leds. These two leds can flash alternately.

## week 2_ link to drawing machine
- Here is my simply drawing machine recording video. It supposes to be drawing automatically motivated via a motor. However, there are some problems when I try to turn on the machine. First, the motor cannot drive the machine to spin automatically. Next, it might be a friction that affects the movement. I will continue to fix those problems as soon as possible.
