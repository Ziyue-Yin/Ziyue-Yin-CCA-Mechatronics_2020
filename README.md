## week 2_ link to drawing machine
- Here is my simply drawing machine recording video. It supposes to be drawing automatically motivated via a motor. However, there are some problems when I try to turn on the machine. First, the motor cannot drive the machine to spin automatically. Next, it might be a friction that affects the movement. I will continue to fix those problems as soon as possible.
